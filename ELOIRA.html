									<h2>Projects</h2>
                            		<p>The navigation of any modern missile, naval ship, aircrafts and even satellites depends on the performance of Ring Laser Gyroscopes. Total internal refelction (TIR) prisms are crucial components of the RLG's that play an important role in internally reflecting lasers that superimpose to form a firnge pattern. The change in fringe patterns are detected by sensors that enable gyroscopic stabilization and thus aid in navigation without the usage of conventional GPS. </p>
                            		<h3>Optimization of production process of Total Internal Reflection Prisms (Jun 2018 - Jul 2018) </h3><br>
                           			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/20170620163506_20615.jpg" alt="" /></span>I predominantly worked on imporving the Cosmetic Surface quality of the prisms by studying Chemical-Mechanical Planarization which is used in the fabrication of TIRs. The optimization of the production process of TIRs depends on the down force and oscillatory motion of the wafers. To optimize the production process, we collected roughness data of the prisms by operating profilometers and microscopes by identifying 4 data points on each prism. After collecting data, we performed ANOVA (Analysis of variance) between the in-house produced prisms and the supplier to find differences on statistical level. This study helped the scientists to take key decisions in optimizing the production process of TIRs.<br><i> (Fig: Total Internal Reflection Prism)</i></p>
							
                            		<h3>Experiment on behaviour of lasers in extreme temperatures (May 2019 - Jul 2019)</h3><br>
                            		<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/1464369692-3726-new-laser-could-generate-sun-s-core-temperature-instantaneously-l.jpg" alt="" /></span>My second project focused on studying the behavior of laser in extreme temperatures. As we know that lasers travels in the form of waves and the wavelength of these lasers can be adversely affected by temperatures. The purpose of this study was to estimate accurate operating consitions at the component level by collecting laser power data in extreme temperature conditions. My work included collabortion with scientists to design and set up experimental set up in a temperature chamber and perform data analysis. Usually, power of laser decreases with increase in temperature and this was clearly evident from the experimental results. To counter this problem, scientists have been developing cryogenic lasers that are operated in cryogenic temperatures. RLG's usually use inert gas elements in the laser cavities that reduce the thermal effects and imporve the performance of lasers. </p>
                            		<h3>Design Optimization of Magnetic Sheilds used in Ring Laser Gyroscopes (Jan 2020 - May 2020)</h3><br>
                            		<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/791f87652b4149e0d906769e0a6f41411aa8b95c44904c0254b59afa71d9dca2.png" alt="" /></span>My final project focused on developing magnetic sheilds for RLGs. For the electronic components to work efficiently, it's important to insulate them from magnetic feilds. We started off by conducting literature survey on the materials used for magnetic sheilding such as Mu metals and Perm alloys. We modelled the sheilds using CATIA V5 and made several iterations of design by adding layers and varying the thickness of the material. We also simulated the model in COMSOL Multiphysics to compare the magnetic flux density and sheild effectiveness for different models. We found that smoothing the edges of the model will reduce the magnetic flux density, thus improving the effectiveness. </p>

									<h2>Challenges:</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Being an intern, it was very difficult to gel with scientists. I had to align my thoughts and work ethic to put myself on par with the work done by full time employees. </li>
										<li>I also had to overcome the challenge of being seen as a temporary student who would make negligible impact. But I was determined to create considerable amount of impact that opened my doors to work on 2 more projects and gain valuable experience.</li>
